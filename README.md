This is my first extension in my life, so i'm keeping it real. Using AI only if i don't get something for hours of brain scratching(i scratch my brain a lot coz why not)...
- Haven't use copilot as its exceded its limits (btw its annonying as hell)
- Only using ChatGPT after losing lots of hair (i scratch my brain first, coz i wanna improve myself not large companies' models... btw who wrote these true words?)
- Started from scratch with CRA(create react app, u dumb)
- Learning and building

# What i did while coding?

- writing songs b/w codes when i am frustrated with bugs
- thinking about new features (i wanna make it large so that i can eat your internet and your browser)
